#### Software Engineer, iOS Input Experience <span class="date">2016–2019</span>
{:#input-experience}

Maintained and extended the iOS keyboard and autocorrect system (primarily the QuickPath path-based keyboard). Accomplishments include:

- implementing the backend of the [QuickPath keyboard on iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2XyP7iUErI), which converts a path traced  by the user's finger into a set of candidate words
- writing a system for evaluating the quality of the QuickPath keyboard by replaying recorded paths from testers and counting how many of them result in the correct word being inserted into the document
- writing a system for training the parameters of the autocorrect model using stochastic hill-climbing
- integrating machine-learning-based typing models into QuickPath
- improving the autocorrect experience for languages with diacritics and multiple keyboard layouts on iOS, including German, Spanish, and Turkish

- implementing French dynamic accent key support
- implementing input transliteration for Tamil input methods (both Anjal and Tamil 99)

#### Software Engineer, OS X Software Updates Integration <span class="date">summer of 2007; 2008–2011</span>
{:#sui}

Carried out the dual missions of ensuring the quality of OS X software updates and writing the tools to automate said testing. Quality work includes OS-wide bug diagnosis, manual testing, and bug triage. Tools I contributed to include:
- an automated pre-submission testing service for OS X software update builds
- a test results database, consisting of a Rails/PostgreSQL
server and an Objective-C framework client 
- a service for quickly NetBooting into historical builds of OS X for bug regression
- a Ruby library for manipulating remote machines over SSH and SCP
- various regression tests for OS X, including kernel extension validation, moveable-apps functionality check, and UI-level tests for Calculator, Script Editor, and TextEdit

Other projects include:
- an effort to improve the performance of Colin Percival’s [bsdiff](https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) tool
- a prototype note-taking app which automatically detects and displays cross-references between pages in the notebook
- a proof of concept for WYSIWYG inline equation editing in Cocoa’s NSTextView
- a search engine for internal projects’ source code

Smaller hacks include:
- extending the Python interpreter with Objective-C method invocation syntax, to make Objective-C method calls in [PyObjC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC) feel more natural
- work toward a general-purpose random-access compression algorithm (eventual goal is efficient file system compression of very
large files)
- a Python bytecode interpreter in Javascript, which allows Python to run in the browser
- a Cocoa app that periodically prompts users to tell it what they are doing and appends it to that day’s page in their [VoodooPad](https://www.voodoopad.com) instance.
