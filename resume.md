#### Software Engineer, iOS Keyboard and Text (2011–2014)

Maintained and extended the iOS keyboard and autocorrect system. Accomplishments include:

- implementing retrocorrection, which allows autocorrect to change more than one word at a time and correct “well see” to “we’ll see” and “new york” to “New York”
- implementing next-word candidate generation and UI animation, by collaborating with the Human Interface and Natural Language Processing teams and extending the autocorrection engine
- implementing French dynamic accent key support
- implementing input transliteration for Tamil input methods (both Anjal and Tamil 99)
- writing custom ICU collators for matching user input with autocorrect candidates
- integrating autocorrection with the Natural Language framework, including extending and documenting the binary autocorrect dictionary format and designing a custom compression scheme for it
- integrating canned responses for the Messages app into the keyboard candidate bar
- converting the autocorrect source repository from SVN to Git
- fixing several build issues brought about by the autocorrect system’s unique cross-OS needs
- adding unit tests and supporting code

Technologies used include C, C++, Objective-C, UIKit, Core Foundation, Core Animation, Core Text, Unicode, ICU, Python, Bash, SQLite, Xcode, OCUnit.

#### Software Engineer, OS X Software Updates Integration (2008–2011)
Carried out the dual missions of ensuring the quality of OS X software updates and writing the tools to automate said testing. Quality work includes OS-wide bug diagnosis, manual testing, and bug triage. Tools I contributed to include:
- an automated pre-submission testing service for OS X software update builds
- a test results database, consisting of a Rails/PostgreSQL
server and an Objective-C framework client 
- a service for quickly NetBooting into historical builds of OS X for bug regression
- a Ruby library for manipulating remote machines over SSH and SCP
- various regression tests for OS X, including kernel extension validation, moveable-apps functionality check, and UI-level tests for Calculator, Script Editor, and TextEdit

Other projects include:
- an effort to improve the performance of Colin Percival’s [bsdiff](https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) tool
- a prototype note-taking app which automatically detects and displays cross-references between pages in the notebook
- a proof of concept for WYSIWYG inline equation editing in Cocoa’s NSTextView
- a search engine for internal projects’ source code

Smaller hacks include:
- extending the Python interpreter with Objective-C method invocation syntax, to make Objective-C method calls in [PyObjC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC) feel more natural
- work toward a general-purpose random-access compression algorithm (eventual goal is efficient file system compression of very
large files)
- a Python bytecode interpreter in Javascript, which allows Python to run in the browser
- a Cocoa app that periodically prompts users to tell it what they are doing and appends it to that day’s page in their VoodooPad instance.

Technologies used in the projects listed above include C, Objective-C, Python,
Ruby, Bash, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Lucene, and the
AppleScript Bridge. 

### Arxan Research, West Lafayette, IN (summer of 2006)
#### Programmer
Tested Arxan’s software tamperproofing solutions, including reverse-engineering
binary x86 and PowerPC code; wrote automated tools to generate patches that
neutralized the software protections; wrote parts of the floating-point unit
for an x86 emulator for in-house testing. Worked with C, C++, Python, x86 and
PowerPC assembly.

### Purdue Genomics Database Facility, West Lafayette, IN (May 2004–May 2006)
#### Student Programmer / Tester
Created a wxWidgets-based GUI for a pre-existing program suite for generational
genetic recombination simulation using Markov chains. Administered Purdue’s
local mirror of the Protein Kinase Resource, including extending its
functionality to support user profiles. Worked with C, C++, Java, Python, Perl,
Ruby, and Bash, as well as Java JNI, Struts, Hibernate, Ant, Apache Tomcat, and
Ruby on Rails.

### Guidant Corporation, St. Paul, MN (summer of 2005; now part of [Boston Scientific](https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/home.html))
#### Programmer, UI Designer
Wrote a wxPython-based application to provide an intuitive graphical interface
for writing requirements-testing procedures for Guidant’s
programmer-reader-monitor device, which is used to communicate with their heart
device line. Wrote a web service which analyzes the testing logs and reports on
which tests are running into the most trouble. Worked with Python, as well as
SQLite, wxPython, SAX, and XSLT.
