**Reckonly** is a revival of
[Kennerley Old Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennerley_Old_Style),
a serif typeface designed by Frederic Goudy in 1911. The tilted 'e', unconventional stress and serifs on 'z', and tapered ascenders lend the typeface an unusual and organic character. I based my revival on scans from the book [*Sculpture of the Exposition Palaces and Courts*](https://archive.org/details/sculptureexposi00jamegoog/page/n12/mode/2up) by Juliet James, published in 1915. I extended the font by giving it a weight axis, with high-contrast and low-contrast variants of the black weight for display vs. text use, respectively.

Reckonly was my project for Term 1 of Type West 2024. You can read the process book and specimen [here](/assets/pdf/Reckonly-Book.pdf), or test the font out below.
