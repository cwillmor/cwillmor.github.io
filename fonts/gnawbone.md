**Gnawbone** is a rounded sans face with significant contrast and strokes that are tapered toward the middle like a bone. It has weight and width axes and a true italic. Gnawbone was inspired by hand-painted signs and memories of the state fair from growing up in Indiana.

Gnawbone was my final project for ILT Academy's [Introduction to Latin Type Design](https://academy.ilovetypography.com/intro-to-latin-type-design/) course in 2022, taught by Malou Verlomme. You can find the specimen [here](/assets/pdf/Gnawbone-Specimen.pdf).
