**Chough** is a monolinear sans serif with high x-height, a true italic, and support for Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Its subtle curves lend it charm and humor.

Chough was my final project for
[Type West 2024](https://typewest.letterformarchive.org/2024/), taught by Maria Doreuli, Christopher Slye, and Miguel Sousa. You can read the process book and specimen
[here](/assets/pdf/Chough-Book.pdf),
or test the font out below.
